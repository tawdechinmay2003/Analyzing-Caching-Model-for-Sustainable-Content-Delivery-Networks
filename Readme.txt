This code contains the major developments I have made until this point. Kindly read
this .txt file before accessing my code.


Purpose: This code consists of multiple Python programs that simulate and analyse
caching schemes based on four major scenarios depending upon the traffic congestion,
operational load and demand. The purpose of the simulation is to lay out a
fundamental study on the behavior of various caching schemes under diverse conditions
which can further help in efficiently choosing them for specific transmissions, which in
future can put a halt to the monotonous use of single schemes for all operations and
under usage of bandwidth leading to an increase in energy consumption and carbon emissions
emissions for CDN. I have used a  graphical neural network in this version of the code
