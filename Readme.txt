Purpose: This code consists of a multiple python programs that simulate and analyse caching schemes based on four major scenarios depending upon the traffic congestion, operational load and demand. The purpose of the simulation is to lay down a fundamental study on behaviour of various caching schemes under diverse conditions which can further help in efficiently choosing them for specific transmissions which in future can put a halt to the monotonous use of single schemes for all operations and under usage of bandwidth leading to increase energy consumption and carbon emissions for CDN.\
