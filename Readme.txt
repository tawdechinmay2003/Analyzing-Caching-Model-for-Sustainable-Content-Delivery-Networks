This code contains the major developments I have made until this point. Kindly read
this .txt file before accessing my code.


Purpose: This code consists of a multiple python programs that simulate and analyse
caching schemes based on four major scenarios depending upon the tra?ic congestion,
operational load and demand. The purpose of the simulation is to lay down a
fundamental study on behavior of various caching schemes under diverse conditions
which can further help in e?iciently choosing them for specific transmissions which in
future can put a halt to the monotonous use of single schemes for all operations and
under usage of bandwidth leading to increase energy consumption and carbon
emissions for CDN.
